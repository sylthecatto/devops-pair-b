# Changes to rhel10CIS

## June 2026 — QA pass: tag, toggle, and hygiene fixes

- Fixed 6 CIS level/profile tag mismatches against v1.0.1 recommendations (1.1.2.5.1, 1.8.5, 2.1.11, 2.1.20, 3.3.2.1, 6.3.3.22) — includes a `level2- workstation` typo (stray space) on 6.3.3.22
- **Behavior change**: `rhel10cis_nfs_server` and `rhel10cis_rpc_server` now default to `false` (was `true`, contradicting `*_mask: true` on the same services — services were configured to be both kept running and masked simultaneously)
- Removed a dead `notify:` on 6.3.3.10 referencing a non-existent "update auditd" handler (correct handler is "Restart auditd")
- Removed `export_badges_public.yml` and `update_galaxy.yml` from `.github/workflows/` — these are public-mirror-only workflows and should not exist in this private repo
- Fixed LICENSE copyright casing (`Mindpoint` → `MindPoint`)
- Rebranded README Twitter badge to X (`x.com/AnsibleLockdown`)
- Added `prompt.md` and `test_inv` patterns to `.gitignore`
- Minor README grammar fix
- molecule added
- ansible_facts context change from ansible_facts.distribution to ansible_facts['distribution']
- Moved prelim tasks to control areas for easier management
- vars containing warning moved to actual task
- container vars file now a variable
- enable multiple line in the audit template
- 2.1.x service and pkgs logic vars now in vars/main.yml enabled a more agnostic OS approach going forward
- 5.4.3.3 thanks to @mboeker public pr #99 for raising this
- aide improvements thanks to @thuliumdrake
- 6.2.2 addressed some controls thanks to public issue #98 and @mboeker
